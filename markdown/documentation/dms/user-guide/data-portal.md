title: Using the Data Portal

The following sub-sections describe how to perform common tasks in the Data Portal that an end user would be interested in.

# Logging Into the Portal

A user may need to log into the Portal so that they can generate an API token to use for data upload or download tasks.

To log into the Portal, from any page:

1. Click **Login** in the top-right corner in the header.  The login page is displayed:

![Entity](../assets/login-page1.png 'Login Page')

2. Select the identity provider that you wish to login with.  The following example uses ORCiD:

![Entity](../assets/orcid-login.png 'ORCiD Login')

3. Grant access to the DMS platform to your profile on the identity provider.  For example:

![Entity](../assets/orcid-grant2.png 'ORCiD Grant Access')

<Warning>**NOTE:** If you deny access to the DMS platform, then your only alternative is to log in again with a different identity provider with which you are comfortable granting access.</Warning>

4. After granting access, if the email address on your identity provider profile is not configured to be publicly-accessible, you may receive an error message indicating so:

![Entity](../assets/no-email.png 'No Primary Email')

If the identity provider you are using allows such a setting, you must change the email to be accessible.  For instructions on how to do so, see [here](../../installation/configuration/prereq/emails).  However, if you do not wish to make your email accessible for that provider, your only alternative is to log in again with a different provider that does not have such a setting, or for which you do not mind exposing the email.

5. Once successfully logged in, the name from your identity provider profile is displayed in the top right, and the **Profile & Token** page is accessible:

![Entity](../assets/logged-in.png 'Logged In')
