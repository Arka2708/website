Before the interactive DMS installer can be used to configure and deploy the DMS platform, a series of pre-requisite system checks and installation steps must be performed:

1. [Decide local vs server deployment](./deployment-mode)
2. [Check system requirements](./requirements)
3. [Check other requirements](./other)
4. [Install Docker](./docker)
5. [Install DMS executable](./executable)

For detailed instructions on these tasks, continue reading through the subsequent installation sections.
