title: Check System Requirements
---

Once you have [decided your deployment mode](../deployment-mode), check that the environment you will be deploying to meets the minimum system requirements.

# Operating System

The DMS currently supports deployment to platforms running these operating systems:

- Linux
  - (??? distributions & versions ???)
- MacOS (??? version ???)

# Minimum System Requirements

| # CPU Cores | Processor Speed | Memory | Disk Space |
| ------------| ----------------| -------| -----------|
| 6 | ??? | 6 GB | ??? |

If your system does not meet the minimum requirements, you will need to upgrade to the minimum to deploy the DMS.  If you are part of an institution, you may need to consult with your IT department about acquiring the additional resources.
