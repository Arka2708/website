title: Check Other Requirements
---

After [checking your minimum system requirements](../requirements), next you must also check that certain additional, ancillary requirements are also met.

Specifically, make sure of the following:

1. **You are comfortable and familiar using a command-line interface** - Installation and configuration of the DMS and supporting software is largely done via command-line.


2. **You have SSH access to the environment you are deploying to** - Specifically for deployments to remote servers, you will need to remotely access the server via SSH to perform certain operations.


3. **You have the ability to _sudo_ on the environment you are deploying to** - Certain operations or programs may need to be run with you assuming the security privileges of another user (e.g. as an administrator).

If you do not have SSH access or **_sudo_** capability, you will need to acquire them. If you are part of an institution, you may need to consult with your IT department for support with these items.
