title: Check the DMS Executable and Version
---

Before running the interactive configuration, make sure you are running the latest DMS version.  This also serves as a check that the executable can run properly:

```shell
dms version
```

The latest version displays successfully (where _x.y.z_ is the latest version):

```shell
x.y.z
```
