title: Select the Cluster Deployment Mode
---

First select the cluster deployment mode, which you should have thought through and [decided earlier in the installation pre-requisites](../../installation/deployment-mode).

<Warning>**NOTE:** You must choose the same deployment mode you decided earlier, since all of your pre-requisite setup would have been based on that decision.</Warning>

```shell:
Select the cluster mode to configure:
  1: LOCAL
  2: SERVER
Enter your choice: 1
```
