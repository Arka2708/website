title: A Note About Arranger Configuration
---

[Arranger]((../../../../../arranger)) is a key service in Overture, allowing administrators to configure what data to expose in their data portal based on the deployed Elasticsearch index.

Although Arranger does not have any configurations required in the DMS configuration questionnaire, it has mandatory configuration tasks after a successful cluster deployment.

For details of these tasks, see [Add Project to Arranger-UI](../../deploy-and-verify/arranger-ui) later on.
