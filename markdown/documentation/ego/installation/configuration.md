title: Configuration
---

Now that Ego has been successfully [installed](/documentation/ego/installation/installation) and the first user and first application have been configured, you are free to configure the other entities in Ego you need to meet your requirements.  This may include adding policies that govern permissions to your application, adding groups and users who will use your application, or even registering new applications.

Although the [API](/documentation/ego/user-guide/api) REST endpoints can be used for any Ego operations, it is highly recommended that administrators use the Admin UI where practical.  The web interface provides an easy-to-use, central place to manage all your applications, policies, groups, and users.

For instructions on performing these tasks, see the relevant sections in the User Guide:

* [Managing Applications](/documentation/ego/user-guide/admin-ui#managing-applications)
* [Managing Policies](/documentation/ego/user-guide/admin-ui#managing-policies)
* [Managing Groups](/documentation/ego/user-guide/admin-ui#managing-groups)
* [Managing Users](/documentation/ego/user-guide/admin-ui#managing-users)
